## Overview

### The challenge

The user:

- Should be able to create a dynamic grid of square divs on a webpage.
- Can customize the size of the grid by entering the desired number of squares per side.
- Can interact with the grid by hovering the mouse over the squares.
- Should benefit from user input validation that limits the number of squares per side to prevent performance issues.
- Should optionally, experience extra features such as randomizing RGB values.
